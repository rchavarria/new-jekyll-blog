## Attended talks

### [Visual attention: How to guide a machine in the world around us](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2019/programa/visual-attention-how-guide-machine-the-world-around/), by [Miguel Ángel Fernández Torres](https://twitter.com/@imangelft)

- Talk not available yet, in Spanish

He talked about using AI to see the world as human do, to help automate some
tasks that are visually intensive.

What's visual attention? recognize objects, track them, the human ability to
focus on something outstanding.

Features: color, intensity, object orientation, movement, text, scale, shape,...

They use *eye tracking* as input data to know and learn how humans pay attention
to what. So they need lots of this data.

With eye tracking data, they build maps (as heat maps), to create models:

- Spatial models: where humans pay attention in a picture
- Temporal models: how attention change over time. They can detect anomalies.
Big changes tell us about outstanding events (explosions,...)

Classic models (image processing,...) have evolved thanks to convolutional neural
networks (or CNNs).

Input for these networks usually are color and movement.

Applications, what are they doing at the University:

1. Object recognition: to help people with Alzheimer in their daily life and
tasks
2. Accion recognition, such as grabbing objects: to help impaired people
3. Anomaly detection: to automate video surveillance

### [A framework-independent, decoupled frontend architecture for large-scale projects](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2019/programa/framework-independent-decoupled-frontend-architecture-for-large-scale-projects/), by [Carlos Villuendas](https://twitter.com/carlosvillu)

- [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDlp2o2Eh7Q&feature=youtu.be), in Spanish

Carlos presented a front-end architecture, that allows them to build different
sites with the same code base.

They structured the front-end architecture in tiers:

- Core: where business rules live. Here they use an hexagonal architecture to
separate the domain model from the infrastructure.
- Site components: common components, content-container pattern
- Specific components: extend and use the common ones
- Common UI theme
- Specific site UI theme: extend the common theme
- Web app: it just wire theme, components and logic

They started with 5 monoliths, for well-known Spanish sites: motor.es, fotocasa.es,
coches.net, motos.net, milanuncios.es

At some point, they had a single JS file, with 13k lines of code, where *jQuery
was their architecture*.

Knowledge must flow from outside to inside, from UI to business rules.

> A place for everything, and everything in its place

Common components or theme define *tokens* to be overridden by specific components
or themes.

The web app tier wraps and provides coherence to lower tiers. It doesn't provide
new features, it just wires things.

### [Compu-mathe-sci-tics](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2019/programa/compu-mathe-sci-tics/), by [Jennifer Wong](https://twitter.com/mybluewristband)

- [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICi4wmdEoDI), in English

A talk about the `Math` object in JavaScript.

She started talking about history, from math to computer science.

She talked about how math and computer science understand the concept of *function*:
for math it's about input and output relationship, in CS, it's about side effects
and procedures.

Funny thing, the talk was on pi day (March 14th, 3.14)

ES6 adds lots of new methods to `Math` object: e**(x - 1), hypotenuse, trunc,...

JavaScript is not very good at precision. It's admitted even in the standard. Most
mathematical functions are approximations.

She could have demonstrated how most of the `Math` methods work, but the talk
wasn't too much interactive. It was a bit disappointing.

### [Bad UX](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2019/programa/bad-ux/), by [Almudena Martín Castro](https://twitter.com/puratura)

- [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unfZWX8OsJw), in Spanish
- [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15oYiICfH1PclizAo-lDGQfsh_bK-JUb2sNBbBqfVd-Q/edit?usp=sharing)

Talk about UX, users and graphic designs

There are too many apps, but too few designers.

Goals:

1. Provide control to the user, do not control them
2. Feedback: there is no cause without effect, things happen because of something
3. Minimize effort: mechanical (click), visual (noise, images, color) and 
cognitive (decisions, doubts)

Ten errors to fix:

1. You're not your user: users don't know your product as well as you do
2. There's no such thing as a mean user: if you don't measure, you don't know
what your users are using
3. Users don't read the text in your app: your app should be usable even if it's
blurred
4. Users don't have the latest devices (screens, light, internet connection,...)
5. Users don't take optimal decisions: they don't think
6. Do you think saving clicks is really important? clicks are cheaper than thinking
7. Be consistent (similar elements do similar things), use conventions (extracted
from other products)
8. Your app must look nice
9. Dark patterns: to cheat users, to lie them, to force them to do wrong things.
Please, don't do that, don't lie to users.
10. Arg, I missed one :(

I repeat a good idea:

> clicks are cheaper than thinking

### [Let's play with the open web](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2019/programa/juguemos-web-abierta/), by [Jesús M. González Barahona](https://twitter.com/jgbarah)

- [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE7J8nzpycI), in Spanish
- [Playing with the open web](https://jgbarah.github.io/presentations/open-web/), code and examples, worth taking a look

The browser is the greatest platform ever. Much better than any operating system.
It makes the old idea *write once, run everywhere* a reality, not Java.

Browser's APIs are open, and we have different implementations. In fact, we
**need** different implementations.

The speaker showed us and demonstrated us very interactive examples that are
worth a try: [Playing with the open web](https://jgbarah.github.io/presentations/open-web/)

Examples:

1. You can see your phone camera in the browser with 2 JavaScript lines
2. Transform the input of your camera into ASCII art
3. Maps with [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library
4. Virtual reality, [aframe](https://aframe.io/) library

With `aframe` you compose your VR scenes with HTML elements!! And you can manipulate
the VR scene as a DOM document.

Really, really try some of the examples in your browser:

### [Verifying fake news: Newtral](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2019/programa/verificacion-contra-las-fake-news/), by [Ana Pastor](https://twitter.com/_anapastor_), [Inés Calderón](https://twitter.com/ines_calderon) and [Marilín Gonzalo](https://twitter.com/marilink)

- [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMJO2w8vTJw), in Spanish
- [Transparentia](https://newtral.es/transparentia/), the public money search engine.
Try to search public Spanish politicians to know how much they're paid:
Pedro Sánchez (President),
Pablo Casado (President candidate),
Ada Colau (Barcelona mayor),
Manuela Carmena (Madrid mayor)

The speakers are 3 journalists, the main one is a well-known journalist for doing
great questions in interviews. She has a TV program where some data provided by the
interviewee is checked on real time.

> Journalists must be where the public is, we must communicate in the same media
as people communicate to each other (paper, tv, internet, messaging,...)

Newtral creates content that is easy to share, to help spreading the verification
as fast as the news (fake or not).

Are fake news a issue for democracy?

Checking the facts is much harder than making up fake news. It so hard, and it takes
so much effort that technology is needed to help journalist to do the job. They 
mention some machine learning terminology, but not too technical.

The problems with the data the speakers talk, remind me the problems people working
with *open data* talk. Data is open, but it's in different formats, it's incomplete,
with no too much coherence, out of date,...

### [Technology behind movies visual effects](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2019/programa/tecnologia-los-vfx-digitales-para-cine/), by [Carolina Jiménez García](https://twitter.com/okinfografia)

- [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D39he1DwmQg), in Spanish

I expected a technological talk, but it was more related about filming techniques.
Anyway, it was quite visual and interesting.

It started with some history about cameras.

One main trick used for a long time is to use a glass, where half the scene has
been painted, and film the movie scene through the glass, playing with
perspective.

Then, there are some process, like Williams process or Dunning process, that lead
us to the *chroma*.

First, it was used a blue chroma, because blue is the most different color from
the human skin (making it easier to replace for other things during movie edition).
Nowadays, in digital filming, a green chroma is used, because digital sensors are
more sensitive to green than to blue or red.

### [Guardians of the Front galaxy](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2019/programa/guardianes-galaxia-front/), by [Cristina Ponce](https://twitter.com/CristinaGrim) and [Cristina Fernández](https://twitter.com/cristinafsanz)

- [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qM0qsUu50), in Spanish
- [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YHJPZjEJbgeoWIvZOwmNyOCGogI60vBiYMTtk0al-z8/edit#slide=id.g35f391192_00), half English, half Spanish

They showed us lots and lots of suggestions for clean code (*guarding* us from 
bad code). The sad part is that they didn't explain them deeply. At some point,
they were just saying the name of the concept.

I got some nice ideas:

`.editorconfig`, it's a convention (supported in PhpStorm with a plugin) to 
configure some parameters in software projects such as: tabs vs spaces, 
indentation,...

ESLint to check JavaScript style, best with published guides: airbnb, google,...

[StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/), the same but for CSS

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), git hooks without the need of 
installing them on `.git/hooks`

Of course, they mention tests, all kind of them: unit, integration, end-to-end,
coverage,... But, they didn't go deep on any of them.

Team workflow: protect some branches, pull requests.

Automatic deployments. They showed a case with GitHub pages and Netlify. They
use Circle CI, a tool similar to Jenkins.

### [Subscribe, like and another way to spread science](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2019/programa/suscribete-dale-like-y-descubre-otra-forma-de-comunicar/), by [Rocío Vidal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoXtmmnLCbXDiSo8GxsmOzA), [Santi García Cremades](http://youtube.com/raizdepi), [Carlos DotCSV](https://www.youtube.com/c/dotcsv) and [Javier Santaolalla](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCns-8DssCBba7M4nu7wk7Aw)

- [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPUTne4v7OY), in Spanish
- [Carlos' YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/dotcsv), about Math, AI and Machine Learning

The speakers are four well-known Spanish youtubers. One of them have a channel
about AI and machine learning, and another one about math in general. The 
conversation was nice, because they're used to interact with people. The idea
was to have a moderator that asked some questions, and each of them give his
own experience.

Are youtubers free about creating content? They say they're more free than in a
traditional media, but they say nothing whether they create content guided by
likes or subscriber numbers.

All of them agree on the fact that they don't want the tool, the mean, YouTube,
to control what the want to communicate.

Can someone live out of YouTube? They agree on you can, but you never know for
how long it will be that way. Maybe tomorrow you're out of business.

Is YouTube adult? Other social media are much younger. Other social media are
evolving to other activities (twitch -> games, instagram -> celebrities,...), but
YouTube seems to have its place among all social media.

They told too that popular science has a great momentum right now.

They discussed about YouTube algorithm, and it seems to be as well known (or as
well unknown) as Google search algorithm. The only thing they know is that it
seems to like videos that keep the audience online, but it doesn't mean the video
is good. There are popular videos of irrelevant or even malicious things.

They were asked about why science audience seems to be mostly men. They talked
about the algorithm here too. One cause can be that if YouTube knows you're a man,
it suggests you science channels. If you're a woman, it suggests you other kind
of channels.

- [Advanced microservices with Micronaut](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2019/programa/microservicios-avanzados-con-micronaut/), by [Iván López Martín Morgado](https://twitter.com/ilopmar): how to make IT work environment more reasonable, human, nice and productive (better)
- [Shooting hoops with machine learning](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2019/programa/shooting-hoops-with-machine-learning/), by [Zack Akil](https://twitter.com/ZackAkil), [English talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE8WAeuLMGk)

## Ideas

I talked to a friend about push notifications. At work, they implemented
*offline notifications*. They're able to show notifications in the browser
even when the tab of their product is closed. The tech behind this is
Service Workers (and websockets for notifications I think). The idea is
quite interesting: you login into EVSM, you close the tab, if anything new
happens, you're notified with a link to the task you need to perform. Nice!

Use [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) maps instead of Google Maps. The library
is open source, and it can show map tiles from different sources.
