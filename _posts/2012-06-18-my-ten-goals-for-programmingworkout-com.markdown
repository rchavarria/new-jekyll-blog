I don't remember exactly, but I think I arrived to 
[programmingworkout.com](http://programmingworkout.com) web through one person 
I follow on twitter (but I can't remember who, sorry). The idea looked to me 
very interesting, and I decided just to sign in. I completely forgot about it, 
but last week I received an email from Michal Taszycki 
([@mehowte](http://twitter.com/mehowte)).

In this email, Michal challenges me (and 500 others) to complete three tasks:

- Collect at least 10 goals: write down anything you want to achieve
- Think about a vision: imagine a vision of your future self
- Connect with others: friend/follow/meet at least three strangers

<!-- more -->

So, to complete my first task, here there are the list of my ten goals I want 
to achieve in a near future. Some of them are not very specific or follow the 
[SMART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) principles, but I have 
something to start with.

- Master command line tools (specially, *nix command line)
- Learn some shell scripting language: windows shell, unix shell, awk, whatever
- Proficiency with type writting
- Know more IDE shortcuts (I use eclipse in my daily basis)
- Learn more about design patterns
- Regular expressions
- Practice groovy/grails programming language
- OOP principles ([SOLID](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod),
pdf [summary](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf))
- Practice TDD
- Learn how to use [vim](http://www.vim.org/)

The second task is to imagine a vision of my future self. I didn't think about 
it too much, so I don't have a clear idea. It should be something like being 
a good professional developer, contributing to open source projects, 
participating in an excelent team of professionals, or something related. But, 
it is still too vague to describe it.
